# Simple-Linear-Regression

Here I have worked on two datasets namely Delivery Dataset and Salary Dataset.
In case of Delivery Dataset i have predicted delivery timing using sorting time.
In both the pyhton file I have built different models using different transformations like exponential,square transformation and square root transformation,
straight line etc.
Calculated their R squared and adjusted R square value too and then compared it and the decided that which model is better.For model validation
Did EDA and visualisation too for better understanding fof data and its mean,standard deviation.Also about the outliers.
Drew Q-Q plot of residuals too.
The Q-Q PLOT of residuals in the case of staright line transformation shows almost normal distribution.
Drew boxplots to check for outliers and histogram too.


Assumptions of linear regression?

1) Linearity of independent and dependent variable
2) Errors should be normally distributed with mean of zero
3) Errors have equal variance
4) Errors are independent
